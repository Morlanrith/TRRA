Hello! 
This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 0.3 of the mod, which now features the sword "Gambol Shroud".
The hope is to continue working on this mod in the coming weeks, with the next update adding the final weapon before the 1.0 release of this mod, the Ember Celica.

This mod currently includes the following:
Crescent Rose: A dual use weapon that is capable of operating as either a Scythe with a dash, or a Sniper Rifle. It can be constructed using a Death Sickle, a Sniper Rifle and some Red Paint.
Myrtenaster: A dual use weapon that works as a fast striking rapier, and ranged weapon. It also features a fire variant that can be swapped to. It can be constructed using a Flying Dragon, a North Pole and some White Paint.
Gambol Shroud: A dual use weapon that works as a quick slashing sword with a dodge, as well as a gun that can be swung at enemies. It can be constructed using an Uzi, a Spooky Hook and some Black Paint.
Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod. These are owned by Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC.
