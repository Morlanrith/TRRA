Hello! 
This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 1.0 of the mod, which currently features the weapons used by the title characters of the show.
These weapons can be obtained by combining pre-existing weapons with a newly added drop from the Golem boss.
This mod has been in development for a few weeks now, and for now will continue to be so, with the next planned update introducing new aspects to the mod along with another weapon.

This mod currently includes the following:
Crescent Rose: A dual use weapon that is capable of operating as either a Scythe with a dash, or a Sniper Rifle.
Myrtenaster: A dual use weapon that works as a fast striking rapier, and ranged weapon. It also features a fire variant that can be swapped to.
Gambol Shroud: A dual use weapon that works as a quick slashing sword with a dodge, as well as a gun that can be swung at enemies.
Ember Celica: A dual use weapon that works as a melee shotgun with a charge, as well as a homing rocket launcher.
New Accessories: Two new accessories which are designed to improve the players melee and ranged damage output. They can be constructed from the current class emblems.
Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod. These are owned by Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC.
