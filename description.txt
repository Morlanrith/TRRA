Hello! 
This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 0.4 of the mod, which now features the shotgun gauntlets "Ember Celica".
This update also improves the function look of both Crescent Rose and Myrtenaster.
The hope is to continue working on this mod in the coming weeks, with the next update planned being a version 1.0 release, which will be adding some minor changes as well as a new accessory designed for use with the weapons.

This mod currently includes the following:
Crescent Rose: A dual use weapon that is capable of operating as either a Scythe with a dash, or a Sniper Rifle. It can be constructed using a Death Sickle, a Sniper Rifle and some Red Paint.
Myrtenaster: A dual use weapon that works as a fast striking rapier, and ranged weapon. It also features a fire variant that can be swapped to. It can be constructed using a Flying Dragon, a North Pole and some White Paint.
Gambol Shroud: A dual use weapon that works as a quick slashing sword with a dodge, as well as a gun that can be swung at enemies. It can be constructed using an Uzi, a Spooky Hook and some Black Paint.
Ember Celica: A dual use weapon that works as a melee shotgun with a charge, as well as a homing rocket launcher. It can be constructed using a Tactical Shotgun, a Rocket Launcher and some Yellow Paint.
Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod. These are owned by Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC.
