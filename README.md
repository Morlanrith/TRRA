# TRRA

Hello!

This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 2.0.3 of the mod, a working version of its update to work with a version 1.4 updated tModLoader.
This version is likely to recieve additional updates as the 1.4 alpha for tModLoader continues development, in order to adjust behaviours.

This update includes a new fire method for the Floating Array weapon added in the last update, a deadly laser that can be used in place of the summoned blades (providing some have already been summoned).

This mod currently includes the following:

New Weapons: A variety of weapons from the original series. Most of these weapons utilise a transform function that gives them dual use.

New Accessories: Two new accessories which are designed to improve the players melee and ranged damage output. They can be constructed from the current class emblems.

New Resource - Dust: A new resource based on the substance from the original series, these crystals will spawn throughout the world upon defeating Plantera. (NOTE: CONDITION CHANGED FROM MECH BOSSES TO PLANTERA)

New NPC: A new town NPC that sells a variety of Dust related items which are required to craft the various weapons and ammo, as well as produce more Dust.

Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

Known Issues:
Existing Princess NPC is missing happiness dialogue for the new Shopkeep NPC

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod.
