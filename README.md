# TRRA

Hello!

This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 1.1 of the mod, which now features spawning Dust crystals, a new NPC and a new weapon "Hush" (Neo's parasol).
This is the current final version of the mod, with no additional versions planned besides an update that will allow it work with a version 1.4 updated tModLoader.

This mod currently includes the following:

New Weapons: A variety of weapons from the original series. Most of these weapons utilise a transform function that gives them dual use.

New Accessories: Two new accessories which are designed to improve the players melee and ranged damage output. They can be constructed from the current class emblems.

New Resource - Dust: A new resource based on the substance from the original series, these crystals will spawn throughout the world upon defeating the mechanical bosses.

New NPC: A new town NPC that sells a variety of Dust related items which are required to craft the various weapons and ammo, as well as produce more Dust.

Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod.
