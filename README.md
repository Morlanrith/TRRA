# TRRA

Hello!

This is TRRA, a mod designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into Terraria.
This is version 3.1.0 of the mod, which includes a new weapon "Harbinger" (Qrows Scythe). This weapon is capable of transforming between a sword and a scythe, and in line with most of the other TRRA weapons, has earlier game variants which are used to eventually progress to the final version.

This update also includes a few minor adjustments/fixes, as well an additional bonus weapon which is a reference to the new series "Ice Queendom".

This mod currently includes the following:

New Weapons: A variety of weapons from the original series. Most of these weapons utilise a transform function that gives them dual use.

New Accessories: Two new accessories which are designed to improve the players melee and ranged damage output. They can be constructed from the current class emblems.

New Resource - Dust: A new resource based on the substance from the original series, these crystals will spawn throughout the world upon defeating Skeletron.

New NPC: A new town NPC that sells a variety of Dust related items which are required to craft the various weapons and ammo, as well as produce more Dust.

New Event: A new 'blood moon' style event called the 'Shattered Moon', during which the creatures of Grimm will swarm the surface. This event will start randomly occuring at the beginning of night once Plantera has been defeated.

Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod. Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod.
