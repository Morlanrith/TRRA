# TRRA

Hello!

This is TRRA, a mod for the game Terraria designed to bring elements of the online web series RWBY into the game.
This is the initial 0.1 version of the mod, which currently features a single weapon from the series, Crescent Rose. 
The hope is to continue working on this mod in the coming weeks, with the next update adding the sword Myrtenaster.

This mod currently includes the following:

Crescent Rose: A dual use weapon that is capable of operating as either a Scythe with a dash, or a Sniper Rifle. It can be constructed using a Death Sickle, a Sniper Rifle and some Red Paint.

Transform Hotkey: An additional hotkey for use with the new weapons in this mod (currently only Crescent Rose). Causes the weapons to change from one form to another.

It should go without saying, but I do not own the copyright to the weapon designs implemented in this mod. 
These are owned by Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC.
